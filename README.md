# Data-Base-Epilobee
Computational project : analysis of the [EPILOBEE dataset](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/honey-bee-seasonal-mortality-2012-2014-epilobee-analysis).

Analyze the Epilobee dataset using SQL language and phpMyAdmin queries - EPILOBEE was the first active epidemiological surveillance program implemented in 17 EU Member States, over 2 consecutive years (from autumn 2012 to summer 2014).

Files :

- IGI-3014-CLARET.sql : the database and tables were created directly on the phpMyAdmin website using the available tools, then the SQL code of creation was retrieved and save as .sql.

- requete.ipynb : used to generate SQL queries to feed the tables thanks to the dataframe.

- resultats : excel file for each table, formatted to be able to feed the database.
